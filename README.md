The file MFML.ipynb is the main part, it include the method in this paper we have implemented.
At first, it's error  rate by cross validation leave one outof original KNN with different k.
I also define a class to simplify the computation of neighbour, potential function, etc.

It's also have the method I write in 6.1.


For the file KNN_radio.ipynb is about the method I proposed with chapter 6.2. We can call it KNN radio method.
It show the average error rate by cross validation leave one out of KNN radio method and the time to it and compare with the Original KNN.

For all the .ipynb file, you can open see the result directly in github. If you want to run it, you can open it with Colab online or download it then open it with jupyter notebook.
